This is the source code for the first assigment of University of Southern Maines Text Mining course.

To run the program firstly you will need to install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After the requirements have been installed run the scraping.py
```
python scraping.py
```

Then after all the data has been collected run analysis.py
```
python analysis.py
```
Also if you want to see what the wordpiece tokenizer does to the supplied senetence run this command
```
python wordpiece.py

After doing this you will have 2 html files which are the scripts to the movies, 2 text files which contain Michael Corleone's dialgoue, 2 text files containing the words he has spoken, and 2 wordclouds for each movie.
